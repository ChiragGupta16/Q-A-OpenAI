### Overview
The web app is made using Streamlit framework.<br> In this app, user can ask a question and the model will answer it. With the help of LangChain, we have used HuggingFace API to send the question and get the answer. The said process is initiated only when the submit button is clicked and the reply is displayed on the screen.
